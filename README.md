Objective

Analyze why the month-end financial close is delayed and recommend process improvements to reduce timeline variability.

Problem

Organizations often struggle with unpredictable closing timelines due to dependencies across departments and manual reconciliation activities.

Approach

Built a synthetic close calendar dataset

Identified performance trends across months

Detected bottlenecks using delay analysis and heatmaps

Assigned responsibility using departmental delay contribution

Analyzed workflow behavior using Gantt timeline

Proposed an optimized parallel close structure

Key Insights

Delays originate upstream before reporting stage

Reconciliation and accrual adjustments are primary bottlenecks

Workflow is sequential rather than parallel

Small delays accumulate to create significant close slippage

Recommendation

Shift from sequential close → parallel close calendar:

Early cut-off deadlines

Automated reconciliations

Department submission SLAs

Expected impact: Reduced close duration variability and improved reporting predictability.
