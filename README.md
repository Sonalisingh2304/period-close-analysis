# Period Close Process Analysis

A business process analytics case study analyzing why month-end financial close timelines become unpredictable and how workflow redesign can improve reporting efficiency.

---

## Objective
To identify operational bottlenecks in the month-end close process and recommend improvements that reduce close cycle variability and improve reporting reliability.

---

## Business Problem
Organizations often struggle to close books on a predictable schedule due to:
- Dependencies across multiple departments
- Manual reconciliation activities
- Sequential workflow structure
- Late arrival of operational inputs

---

## Methodology

1. Simulated a multi-month close calendar dataset
2. Measured close cycle performance trends
3. Identified bottleneck activities using delay analysis
4. Assigned responsibility through departmental contribution
5. Analyzed workflow behavior using timeline modeling (Gantt)
6. Proposed an optimized parallel close structure

---

## Key Insights

- Close delays originate **before reporting stage**
- Reconciliation and accrual adjustments are primary bottlenecks
- Workflow is sequential instead of parallel
- Small delays accumulate into major close slippage
- Responsibility lies with upstream shared services rather than accounting workload

---

## Recommendation

Shift from a sequential close to a parallel close structure:

**Process Improvements**
- Early cut-off deadlines
- Standardized close calendar
- Parallel task execution

**Automation Opportunities**
- Automated reconciliations
- Scheduled journal entries
- Validation rules for adjustments

**Coordination Controls**
- Department submission SLAs
- Close tracking dashboard
- Escalation triggers

**Expected Outcome:**  
More predictable close timelines and faster decision-ready financial reporting.
